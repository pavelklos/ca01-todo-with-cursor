I'll help you modify the existing todo app to work with Firebase. First, we need to add Firebase dependencies and set up the Firebase configuration. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's add Firebase to the project:
[package.json]

2. Create a Firebase configuration file:
[firebase.ts]

3. Update the TodoList component to use Firebase:
[todo-list.tsx]

The main changes include:
1. Added Firebase configuration and initialization
2. Modified the Todo interface to use string IDs (Firestore document IDs)
3. Implemented real-time updates using onSnapshot
4. Added Firebase CRUD operations:
    - Create: addDoc
    - Read: getDocs and onSnapshot
    - Update: updateDoc
    - Delete: deleteDoc
5. Added error handling for Firebase operations
6. Added timestamp for sorting todos
    Make sure your .env.local file (or Replit Secrets) contains these Firebase configuration variables:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

After implementing these changes, your todo app will be fully functional with Firebase as the backend, featuring real-time updates and persistent storage.
